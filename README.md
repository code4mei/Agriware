Crop Yield Prediction using ML
Overview
Agriculture is the backbone of India, yet it remains one of the most under-digitized sectors. With this project, we aim to bridge the gap between technology and farming by introducing a smart, machine learning-based solution that can predict crop yield and recommend optimal crops based on user inputs like location, land area, weather, and season.

Developed by a group of three college students, this solution not only predicts and recommends crops, but also generates customized harvesting guides in PDF format, making it easier for farmers and agricultural enthusiasts to take informed decisions and implement best practices.

Features
✅ Crop Yield Prediction – Predict expected yield based on user-provided parameters.
🌱 Crop Recommendation – Suggest the best-suited crop for a specific region and season.
📄 PDF Generator – Generate a step-by-step farming/harvest strategy for the recommended crop.
📊 Data Visualization – Interactive graphs and plots for better understanding.
🔐 Login/Logout System – Secure authentication for users.
🖥️ User-Friendly Interface – Simple, clean, and responsive UI for all user types.
📚 Educational Tool – Helps users (especially farmers) learn how to grow recommended crops properly.

Technologies Used
Python (core logic & ML)
Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)
Django (backend framework)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization)
ReportLab / FPDF (PDF generation)

Future Enhancements
📡 Real-time weather API integration
📱 Android/iOS mobile app
🧠 Deep learning models for enhanced accuracy
🔊 Voice-based input/output for non-literate users
